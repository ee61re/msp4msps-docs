# Enhanced Filtering Shall be configured if a 3rd party email filtering tool is being used

## Description

Enhanced email filtering can be set up if you have a connector in 365 (3rd party email filtering service or hybrid configuration) and your MX record does not point to Microsoft 365 or Office 365. This new feature allows you to filter email based on the actual source of messages that arrive over the connector. This is also known as skip listing and this feature will allow you to overlook, or skip, any IP addresses that are considered internal to you in order to get the last known external IP address, which should be the actual source IP address.

If you are using Defender for Office 365, this will enhance its machine learning capabilities and security around safe links/safe attachments/anti-spoofing from Microsoftâ€™s known malicious list based off IP. In a way, you are getting a secondary layer of protection by allowing Microsoft to view the IPs of the original email and check against their database.
