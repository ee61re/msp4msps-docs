# Sender Policy Framework SHALL Be Enabled

## Description

The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a mechanism that allows domain administrators to specify which Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are explicitly approved to send email on behalf of the domain, facilitating detection of spoofed emails. SPF is not configured through the Exchange admin center, but rather via the Domain Name Service (DNS) records hosted by the organizationâ€™s domain.

## Policy

* A list of approved IP addresses for sending mail SHALL be maintained
* An SPF policy(s) that designates only these addresses as approved senders SHALL be published.

## Licensing Considerations

Any tenant can configure this setting.
