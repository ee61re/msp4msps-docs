# Teams Email Integration SHALL Be Disabled

## Description

Teams provides an optional feature that allows channels to have an email address and receive email. These channel email addresses are not under the tenantâ€™s domain; rather, they are associated with a Microsoft-owned domain, teams.ms. As such, although some basic checks are performed, companies do not have control over the security settings associated with this email. For this reason, email channel integration should be disabled.

## Policy

* &#x20;Teams email integration SHALL be disabled.

## Licensing Considerations

Teams email integration is only available with E3/E5 licenses. It is not available in GCC or DoD tenants.



## Set Up Instructions
