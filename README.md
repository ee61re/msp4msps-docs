# ðŸš€ Welcome to Tminus365 Docs

## Overview

Tminus365 Docs is a robust expansion of [my blog](https://tminus365.com/). I create many how-to guides, configuration docs, and in-depth technical tutorials so I wanted to start adding them in a structured repository. This also makes it easier to track version control for updates.&#x20;

## Section Overview&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Security </summary>

The security section shows recommend security controls across the Microsoft 365 Suite offerings based on the CIS Controls. Each control contains the following subsections and enablement materials:

* Description
* Policy Definition
* Licensing Considerations&#x20;
* Set Up Instructions
* End-User Impact
* PowerShell Scripts
* Video Tutorials

</details>

<details>

<summary>Configurations</summary>

The configurations section contains relevant how-to information for configuring certain settings across various services and/or vendors.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>CIS Controls</summary>

This section will likely evolve into "Compliance" over time but today it contains links to obtain my premium content where I map Microsoft 365 security configurations to the CIS Controls.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>Vendor Integrations</summary>

This section includes any vendor integration documentation I have created over time. In many cases, it is leveraging the vendor API to perform some type of automation or integration with Microsoft 365.&#x20;
