# CIS Mapped to M365

**Introducing the Comprehensive Security Baselines Guide mapped to CIS Controls**

Are you looking to take your organization's cybersecurity to the next level? When the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released the [Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/FINAL-CSSO\_SCuBA\_Fact\_Sheet.pdf), I was thrilled. However, I quickly realized that I needed more than just a checklist to truly implement robust security measures.

That's why I took it upon myself to create the ultimate guide for securing your Azure AD, Teams, Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Intune environments. The result is the docs that you can find in the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") section of this repository. &#x20;

I'm also have a premium version of the guide, packed with additional valuable resources:
